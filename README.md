# PhonePager
This repo will be a full stack web application that will collect peoples phone numbers, store them in a backend, display them in a front-end table, and allow the user to call the person back up as if they are being "paged".


Project Guidelines/Steps (MVP)

1: Create a basic UI with header and table to display fake data 
2: Create a backend
3: Link backend to frontend and display data
4: Save phone number data to backend
5: Create a button to "call" back the saved phone number in database. "Calling" a phone number sends that phone number a text saying that their food is ready.
